Kafka had a complicated relationship with his domineering father, which influenced much of his writing.",
    contribution: "Known for works like 'The Metamorphosis,' 'The Trial,' and 'The Castle,' Kafka created surreal, nightmarish worlds that explored themes of alienation, existential anxiety, and absurdity.

    name: "Albert Camus",
    lifespan: "1913–1960",
    biography: "A French-Algerian philosopher, author, and journalist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. Born in Algeria to French parents, Camus was raised in poverty by his illiterate mother after his father was killed in World War I. He contracted tuberculosis at age 17, which prevented him from continuing his football career. During World War II, he joined the French Resistance and served as editor of the underground newspaper Combat.",
    contribution: "As a pioneer of absurdism, Camus explored themes of the human condition, alienation, and rebellion against meaninglessness in works like 'The Stranger,' 'The Myth of Sisyphus,' and 'The Plague.' His philosophical writings rejected both religious faith and existential despair in favor of a moral code based on rebellion, freedom, and passion. Camus died in a car accident at age 46, with an unfinished manuscript—'The First Man'—found in the wreckage.",
